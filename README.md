Mixins are a powerful concept for object-oriented class composition. re-mix provides mixins for C# and Visual Basic .NET.

Source Code: https://svn.re-motion.org/svn/Remotion/trunk

While C# and VB.NET are continuously improving, they still support only a single mechanism for class composition: single inheritance. Over the years, many other mechanisms have been tried, among them multiple inheritance, mixins and traits. These mechanisms allow for a more flexible composition of classes from various sources, therefore enabling new programming techniques that reduce code redundancy, increase the expressiveness of code and allow for a more direct mapping of mental models to code.

Some of the features of re-mix are:
* Create mixins that add interfaces with implementations and state to other classes
* Override class methods in mixins
* Implement abstract mixin methods in classes that use mixins
* Apply any number of mixins to any class
* Apply mixins statically via attributes, or dynamically via code
* Apply mixins on application startup without starting any tools, or at build-time as you prefer
* Add and remove attributes via mixins
* Mixins can derive from each other, and mixins can even be applied to mixins
